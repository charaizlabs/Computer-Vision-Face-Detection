Computer-Vision-Face-Detection
==============================

Written in MATLAB, this is the final project of Boston College's Computer Vision class. The purpose of this program is to first detect faces in a photo, and second - if time permits - recognize those face or cross reference attributes of those faces, deducing similarities (a percent chance of relation).
